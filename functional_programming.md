## Functional Programming

Its like refactoring what you already know about programming. 

### Things to have in mind

When you want to redesign something, the first thing you do is put all the pieces that already work right in the table. Doesn't make sense to rewrite something that works well.
What you will do is maybe change some little things, improve this, change this, and put some new things.

### Lets start

To start our process of learning a new paradigm we have to ask ourselfs what we already know. What are the subjects that you have in common with a functional programmer. 

Here comes the list of things that we **already know**:

* namespaces
* arrays
* hashes 
* strings 
* numerics
* booleans
* identation
* names
* ifs
* iteration

Here comes the list of things that **we KINDA doesn't know**:

* pure functions (look at input and produce output, without changing anythings, without side effects, no deleting files, updating databases.)
* f(x)
* all of our data structures are immutable (you will work with copies)


### Mathematical function 

> They dont change over time. They are always the same, and have the same behavior.

- Domains
- Subdomains

For any given input it always gives you the same output.
